# HW-7 Readme for Tobin Long

This was very hard, and I am not finished with the project. I'm just going to turn in what I have for now and keep working on it. At the very least I can style it some more.

I'm still a little confused on how the DOM works and all the nodes relate to eachother. Need to keep practicing that. The hardest part was showing and hiding certain things. I tried following along with the examples, but every time i tried to show text when clicking the "yes" and "also yes" button, I would screw something else up. I probably made this way harder than it should be.

I started working on this as soon as it was assigned, but still haven't figured it out. I guess I'm just one of those people who needs to see exactly how it is done before I can do it myself.

**UPDATE**

After the extension I just started over. I went with a much more simple approach and actually styled the page. I would eventually like to learn out to show/hide the rest of the elements better, but I have to move on for now.
