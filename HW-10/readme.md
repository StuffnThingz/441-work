# HW-10 Readme for Tobin Long

This wasn't too hard of an assignment but I could have used more time to make it great.
I had to go back and look at some of my past projects that were more html and css based.
I used jQuery on the responsive menu for this project due to time constraints. I have done
it with pure Javascript before, I was just having trouble getting it to work with this specific
project and needed to get it turned in... It's about 2:30 in the morning now... For some reason my Home page wasn't linking properly and I know I'm doing something very
stupid to screw it up. Over the summer I plan to learn as much about web development as possible so this stuff is easier.
