# HW-5 Readme for Tobin Long

Another stressful week of coding. I'm finding the MDN web docs pages to be a lot
more helpful than the Eloquent JavaScript. That book is just too confusing. The
MDN pages are far more specific. I wish there were some more detailed video tutorials to show us
how we can work out some these problems. I was lucky to get a little help with problem two
on the issues forum, but it is 12:30 am and I'm just finishing this up. I think
I understood the flow between try, catch, and flow in problem three, but it took
waaaay too long for one problem. The details under the exercises help a little,
but I'm still searching for a better way to learn this stuff. Maybe there is a
JavaScript for Dummies book that would better suit me.
