# HW-9 Readme for Tobin Long

Another tough on for me. Unfortunately, I didn't get to read that much into the jQuery stuff last week.. I used that time to catch up on other classes due to there being no assignment.. So I was a little lost when I came across the jQuery stuff and I'll have to catch up on that over the summer.

The Dan Shiffman tutorials were really helpful, except he was using p5js. I read through all the Mozilla tutorials, and it was a lot to digest. I really wanted to use the Giphy API and finally found a good tutorial from a YouTuber named Joshua Fluke.. I'll make sure to credit him as I pretty much only handled the styling. He used something called Boilerplate, which did a lot of the jQuery stuff behind the scenes. I'm sure I'll learn more about that later.

All in all, I found this all really interesting. I just need more time to learn the finer details.
