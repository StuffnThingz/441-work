### Weekly Review

---
Had to give myself a little refresher on coding this week. I got a little rusty over the break. Overall, the only thing I stuggled with was getting my menu to change from a row to a column at a breakpoint. I figured it out using the flex-direction attribute. I'm sure there is an easier way. Besides that, this assignment went pretty smooth. I was able to look back at past assignments it all started coming back to me.
