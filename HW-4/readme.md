# HW-4 Readme for YOUR_NAME

This was a tough assignment for me. The first two problems weren't too hard, but the rest
were. I'm starting to understand the flow and relationship of the functions and variables a little
better, but still have a long way to go. I'm still trying to figure out the last one and I'm planning
on getting help even if I can't figure it out before this assignment is due. I kind of understand those
arrow functions, but I'm still really confused over how these variable and function keep getting passed
around. I also find the book to be very confusing. It almost like an information overload, and I wish it
were more focused. Same thing with the video tutorials, it is just too much information all at once.
I'll get it eventually, just have to keep practicing.
