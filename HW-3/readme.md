# HW-3 Readme for Tobin Long

I didn't have too much trouble with this assignment since I have taken
Creative Coding 1. The first problem was straight forward and I had no problem
solving it using the materials from the readings. One thing I found useful and
interesting starting on the second problem was the use of an empty string to make
new rows of "#"s.  The third problem was pretty tricky for me. The for loop
is something I'm comfortable with, but the problem solving here was hard for me to
wrap my head around, even after looking examples. Once again, the use of an empty
string came in handy. I found that if you just put two if statments on top of eachother
(one for fizz and one for buzz) you won't need an else statment for "fizzbuzz."
My biggest take away from the assignment, was the use of the empty string. It is definitely
helping me understand the relationship between variables.
