# HW-6 Readme for Tobin Long

It took me a while to wrap my head around this assignment, but it was cool to
see JavaScript in action. It reminded me of some of the stuff we did in
creative coding 1, but with HTML. I had always heard this term "node," but never knew what
it meant. I'm still trying to memorize the terminology as far as the node tree goes,
and how they actually relate once you're coding. The only real problem I ran into,
was trying to get my link to center. With a lot of experimenting I finally set the text-align
to center using the setAttribute method in the div method. I feel like the assignment
was just scratching to surface of what you can do with the DOM, but it helped me get
some understanding of the direction we are going in.
